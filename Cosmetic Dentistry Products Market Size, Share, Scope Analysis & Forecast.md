Crown and bridge products, another key segment, are employed to cover damaged or missing teeth and improve overall dental appearance. The demand for these products is propelled by advancements in materials and technology, which enhance the longevity and appearance of dental restorations. Finally, gum contouring and reshaping procedures are gaining popularity for addressing uneven gum lines and enhancing smile aesthetics.
